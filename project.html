									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>
										The Mimi-box party friendly game device is designed under
										the focus of a score-based fun for all ages game where each
										user has to try and imitate your fellow players voice given
										a turn-based rule set. Being the best mimic in a round will
										award a point in various game modes the point victory count
										and the pre-recorded speaker that will interchange between
										various situations to maintain entertainment, through the
										spontaneity and creativity with your voice utilizing
										accents, tongue twisters and any assortment of sounds the
										player can muster to through the opponent off, with the
										primary intention of inducing unique, ridiculous game play
										with high replay ability.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>
										The reasoning behind the choice of the Mimi box is to have
										normalization of household party games for family and
										friends to enjoy and due to the given circumstances that
										Australia is in.
									</p>
									<p>
										At the current time with "Social distancing and lack of a
										vaccine" people have be unable to be together let alone most
										entertainment being a form of online media gaming or movies.
										Found from the 2006 study that showed "the average 15 to
										34-year-olds spends just under 3 hours with friends and 10
										hours with their family each weekend". With this
										acknowledged and the given current situation COVID-19 brings
										we hope to facilitate the popularity of party games to
										support the demand for social interaction humans need,
										whilst introducing our product to a less populated market of
										modern gaming and be just as a standalone product within a
										global appeal based one functionality given language
										catering. This would function great for instant
										gratification and ideal for family fun nights or party with
										friends to promote social interaction among all members of
										any age and any number of players.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description (design, Gameplay)</h3>
									<p>
										The concept for the basic game loop is after starting the
										game with 2 or more players for the first user to input the
										number of players and then record a sound / message when
										prompted by the mimic box. When ready the player can press
										'speak', this button will allow the user to record their
										input to be stored by the Mimi-box. Prior to the first
										input, each of the players will need to input their name so
										each user input can be identified then pressing skip will
										start the game which will first instruct the player of how
										the game works, with the recorded voice intention of being
										hard to repeat, after which the next and or all player/s
										will attempt to imitate what the first player sounded like
										which can be recalled by the player, and the individual with
										the highest accuracy will be considered the winner of the
										game/ round given the rule set you decide upon as a group.
									</p>
									<p>
										A secondary game mode of the box to be called funny mode
										would provide a pre-stored sound effect which the players
										must aim to imitate collectively and whomever is closet wins
										said round/ game, these recorded inputs by players will have
										a timer to have the input be comparable so you as a player
										are on the clock to provide your statement, joke or accented
										sentence or whatever the player is capable of choosing
										within the frame of ten seconds,
									</p>
									<p>
										The physical device is a raspberry pi that utilizes java and
										frontier series to compare the MEL-Frequency spectrum of a
										user input determined by contrasting the difference in
										frequency/ pitch, between the inputs to determine the most
										efficient match therefore a given winner of a set game of
										Mimi-Box, without any player input the game will pause and
										using the skip button is how to have the game continue
										between turns.
									</p>
									<p>
										The physical design of the box is a 10cm x 10 cm case that
										closely resembles a hexagonal prism that can be seen (link
										here), holds the interior mechanisms audio and power within
										the casing with the boxes centre of mass being focused
										around the base, the device itself is generally expected to
										be utilized by children and or youth or perhaps adults that
										are inebriated, therefore, the device needs to be shock
										absorbent and liquid resistant so reduce direct damage to
										the functional hardware, the powering of the device will
										require 6xAA batteries that are found underneath the device
										in a screw bound compartment,
									</p>
									<p>
										the box has majority of its user inputs taken on the faces
										at the top of the case consisting of five buttons, one
										power, two for volume(up/down) control, skip as a user’s
										continue button on one side and on the other speak, which
										behind the case there are small grated holes and the speak
										button is above when held will record clear and concise
										audio inputs, and on the top an output speaker for the
										device to communicate the directions and next instruction.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Tools and Technology</h3>
									<p>
										The technology at hand is a Raspberry Pi Zero that would be
										arranged to run the game through a java code program that
										would take the users inputs as a measurement in Hz, then you
										would have to make an excerpt of the given audio signal,
										then is the users input and take the frontier transform (a
										composition of a signal over time given as a function that
										is subsequently broken into its constituent expressions of
										frequencies,  From there you have to map the powers of given
										powers in correlation to the Mel spectrum specifically
										utilizing Triangular overlapping windows which provides the
										pitch of the speech given decibels/ amplitude of a
										dictation.
									</p>
									<p>
										This can be used to compare the user pitch of input and to
										do as said you need to take the log of the each of the
										recorded Mel frequency's then performing a discrete cosine
										transform with the list of Mel frequency logged powers,
									</p>
									<p>
										That will be your resulting signal that the other players
										are intending to match with, this is a MFCC's,  in order to
										have the box perform a comparison it will be necessary
										compare each of the recorded Mel frequency's as matrices
										with identical vector signal size hence 10 seconds each is
										consistent per turn to have each matrix line up for
										comparison more dynamically for Frontier transformations,
										where taking the two inputs as A & B and the proposed
										distance between them being C which would function as (CxA)=
										X and (CxB) =y ,(X/Y) = your distance between the two
										frequency MFCC's and this is called speaker adaptation,
										notably the first coefficient provided by the MFCC is an
										expression of loudness, and should be disregarded when the
										intention of the device is the comparison of utterances.
									</p>
									<p>
										The physical components of the case that are found primarily
										within the box are a Adafruit 12S MEMS Microphone for sound
										input as well an mini HAT, the Adafruit 12S 3W Stereo
										Speaker Bonnet mini Kit, using 12S digital sound to create
										clear crisp audio, with the intention of efficiency and
										Saving power, the Mimi-box uses 1 mono 40mm diameter 4 Ohm
										3-watt speaker. The power is provided by a 6xAA battery pack
										connected via a universal battery eliminator circuit that is
										within the aforementioned bottom skew compartment for ease
										of battery change and safe use.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Skills Required</h3>
									<p>
										Given the Raspberry Pi is Linux base operating software, in
										this particular case will need to install and have the
										device run java using Open-JDK as one of the most efficient
										ways to achieve development of variable loops. And
										comparisons as well as have methods to be called by the
										physical inputs of the user as a discrete function which can
										then be compared against each other to determine the winner
										of a round or game and perform various while loops, as well
										as actively declaring the user’s inputs as variables that
										can be correlated to integer values to then be evaluated and
										compared based on intensity/ amplitude to see how accurate
										the repeat of a given sequence is. With that in mind array
										values will need to temporarily store the variables of the
										inputs to match and the recordings that are being compared
										against within a margin of error and loop back turn by turn.
									</p>
									<p>
										The hardware challenges that we will need to individually
										solder the microphone and pins and heads of each component
										to the raspberry Pi but thankfully the components themselves
										can be purchased from Adafruit and Pi hardware and are
										available as a direct bulk purchase, and distribution
										batches yet individual assembly is still required per unit
										production as well as development and implementation of java
										code to function for the game which can be implemented in
										FFT to capture the input and have an active and a copy as to
										store one array, then to compare each active player against
										the first input and log each players score to display at the
										end of a round/game.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>
										Our projects intended proposed idea is a feasible and fun
										game for the family to enjoy on a causal basis as a way of
										inclusive and open to all game to play that would be great
										for a family or making new friends or playing with
										established friends to increase the fulfillment of social
										interaction that we all require. To expand upon the voice
										recognition industry under the guides of creating an
										entertainment system that promotes creative social
										interaction as a household party game it is its purpose to
										draw attention to our needs as people in a modern society
										and revitalize the party game category, using the innovation
										of the dynamic raspberry pi and supporting hardware and
										software to present to you the Mimi-Box.
