Overall, I believe our entire assignment to date has gone well. We have been ahead of date with all tasks.
Outside of a few personal commitments that team members have needed to attend, all meetings have had full
attendance and have been very punctual.

I feel the agenda for each meeting could have been improved upon. We had a shortlist of things each meeting
that we would need to tick the box for the week. As soon as we finished the discussion on these topics, we
were essentially filling in time for the rest of the meeting. A more detailed list of tasks is required in
the future.

It was surprising how well our group got along. There were no arguments, fights, or disagreements. A team
can rarely cohere perfectly together; however, ours seemed to do so. Everyone was very understanding about
the needs of personal commitments that eat into assignment time. After every meeting, team members would
sit around for hours and still chat about the uni courses and assignments, gaming, and plenty of other things.
Team chemistry leads to better results.

What I learned is that everyone can't contribute an exactly equal amount in a team environment. Whilst our
group didn't have any slackers per se, there were 2 or 3 team members who I felt definitely carried a greater
output over the course of the assignment. In a perfect world, everyone would contribute exactly the same
amount; however, in almost all workplaces I've been involved in, there are definitely people who naturally
achieve more than others.

Our Github activity has been a really positive asset to our project. Each member has made outstanding
contributions toward it. Although I am not in the coding part of our team, I imagine GitHub has made
their roles much easier.
