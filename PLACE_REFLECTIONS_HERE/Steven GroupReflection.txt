Overall as a team I believe we worked together rather well. I felt we all got along, were productive with our meetings and showed that we could organise together and willing to take on tasks. All team members were willing to work together to get things done. There is always room for improvement though.

While everyone had a presence in the meetings and the attendance was high, the meetings could definitely be more organised with a clearer focus of what we wish to discuss before going into them. Some meetings did get side-tracked and go off topic, but I also was surprised that the communication between us was high and allowed us to get to know each other better along with each other’s strengths and weaknesses which can be really difficult to establish such friendship in a team environment.

I have learnt that it can also be difficult to organise as a group. Everyone has lives outside of the group and can have unforeseen issues occur outside of work/study. Everyone also has their own preferred style of accomplishing things. Proper planning and communication can help mitigating these issues.
